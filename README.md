## 🌟 Project Overview
 
This is a simple, static web application designed to demonstrate how a user interface can be built with basic web technologies to check lottery numbers against a pre-defined set of winning results[...]
 
The key goal was to create a functional, single-page application (SPA) that can be hosted easily using static site services like **GitHub Pages** or **GitLab Pages**.
 
### ✨ Features

* **Ticket Checker:** Allows users to input a 6-digit number and select a draw date to check for potential matches (simplified prize structure).
* **Draw History:** Dropdown menu populated with available historical draw dates.
* **Clear Disclaimer:** Prominent and mandatory warning that the service is for entertainment only.
* **Affiliate Link Spot:** Dedicated section for a potential link to purchase tickets (currently a placeholder).
 
### 💻 Tech Stack
 
This is a minimalist project built entirely with front-end technologies:
 
* **HTML5:** For the page structure and layout.
* **CSS3:** For modern, clean, and responsive styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all the core logic, including data handling, prize checking, and dynamic content updates.
